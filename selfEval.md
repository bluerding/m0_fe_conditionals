# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
-I definitely still need some practice. I am notcing its becoming more natural, but I want to be able to easily fly through these without having to refer to previous examples.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of the logical operators. I did catch myself messing up with them early on, but once i got the hang if it they were no problem
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- I feel like these are where my main self doubts are coming from. The amount of information seems a little overwhelming, and when I miss something or mess something up I get completely flustered.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- Too long. I got about 75% of the way done with it and realized i never did a git init, and checked my repository and nothing was saving there. I was unable to find a way to get the files to update there so I had to restart the whole thing.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- Just overall fluency and concepts. It's all starting to click, but I think I have set standards for myself a bit to high at this point. I need to spend more time after finishing assignments just redoing CFUs and exercises. I have the time in my calendar for it, but I am not utilizing it.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- If I do not git init, is everything im doing until I do just lost? The answer to this would have saved me time today for sure. I am going to ask the small group today.
